*if you're seeing the `master` branch and want to take a look at the source code, go to the `src` branch!*

this is the code for my personal site.

it uses [lektor](https://www.getlektor.com) to generate the site/blog and [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to deal with assets.

if you have any questions or suggestions, be free to add an issue/pull request or contact me at luciano@ratamero.com.

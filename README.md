*if you're seeing the `master` branch and want to take a look at the source code, go to the `src` branch!*

this is the code for my personal site.

it uses parcel instead of webpack to build, react as a frontend and django_apistar as the backend (in the `ratamero-blog-api` project).

if you have any questions or suggestions, be free to add an issue/pull request or contact me at luciano@ratamero.com.
